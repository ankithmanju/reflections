When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

should see in the coming up videos ! i dont have a clear intuition for that yet!

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Good question!

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
fork ------  copy of someones repository in Github into your Github repository
clones ----  copy of Github in your local machine
branch ----  local copy brached into another copy
