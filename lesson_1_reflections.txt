How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It shows the difference between the original and the change file , line by line!

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

If a new version fails to run ! , refer to the old working version and try to figure out what made the new version not run!

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Tradeoff between when to commit and when not to commit might be a personal choice and not a standard followed by all

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Git basically used for version control of codes , which might have depencies across different files !i.e if a function declaration is changed in .h file , its definition needds to be changed in source code file .c file


How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

use the git log to check the comment of what was done in that commit and use git diff to check for the actual changes

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

I dont need to think of break a working version as i can revert back to it anytime :)
hahaha
